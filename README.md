# UOCIS322 - Project 6 - Ethan Pressley (epressle@uoregon.edu) #
Brevet time calculator with AJAX, MongoDB, and a RESTful API!

## Purpose ##
This project is intended to add an API to the brevet calculator that has been worked on since Project 4.  
By filling out the form in the consumer program, you can get a JSON formatted file and a CSV formatted file returned with the information you choose.
Otherwise, the project is the same as previous and functions identically.

## NOTES ##
This project is missing some key components, such as picking k values, and CSV. This is due to a strange string bug that makes it hard to go through the data.  
This string bug is apparent when viewing the JSON formatted string.
