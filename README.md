# UOCIS322 - Project 6 - Ethan Pressley (epressle@uoregon.edu) #
Brevet time calculator with AJAX, MongoDB, and a RESTful API!

## Purpose ##
This project is intended to add an API to the brevet calculator that has been worked on since Project 4.  
By filling out the form in the consumer program, you can get a JSON formatted file and a CSV formatted file returned with the information you choose.
Otherwise, the project is the same as previous and functions identically.
## NOTES ##
This project is missing CSV still, but the top K values works.
